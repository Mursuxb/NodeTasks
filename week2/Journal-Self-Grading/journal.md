# Week 2
## Peer assessment
Santeri Mulari 5. Did his parts well during the group activities and gave good advice during tasks. Planned the category page for the project model.

Saku Tuomennoro 5. Supported during the task portions of group activity and helped with commands in Postman. Planned the shopping cart page for the project model.

Atte Ristim√§ki 5. Very ethusiastic, helped alot with the group tasks as well as supported during the project visual planning. Planned the product page for the project model.

Kimi Taskinen 5. I was giving advice to group members with API tasks and planning the main structure of the project webpage. During group activities I did my part and helped others when they need help. Planned the home page for the project model.

## Challenges Faced
Our group was getting to know Figma for planning the lowfidelity model for the webpage. Getting postman commands to work with different body contents was kind of difficult.

## What went well and lessons learned
Learned the basics of creating APIs and the basics of running servers. Writing node modules and exporting/importing to a running server. Using Nodemon has taken alot of ease from restarting the server constantly, which occured during our first programming courses.

Others skilles that have improved are communication and time management skills. Team work has continued to work on a smooth level.

## Project management
Getting used to  Scrum is still quite the learning journey but we have tried to manage our roles including during the webpage planning. So far progress has been relatively easy.

We have been quite ethusiastic and have been planning the projects outlook and functionality ahead of time.

## Final thoughts
Overall the second week has been an interesting experience with quite a lot of new information. Alot of impactful information was handled during this week and the next weeks are seemingly going to be more intense.

## Next Steps
Next week we are going to have our first *real* Scrum meetings and prepare for idea presentations.
