Saku Tuomennoro 5. Did a great part preparing and presenting during project presentations. Also still creating tests for the project.

Atte Ristim√§ki 5. Made a huge contribution to the final product to the presentation and was great at presenting.

Kimi Taskinen 5. Managed to finalize the project and present it with my group successfully.

## Challenges Faced
Finalizing the project was not too complicated, especially since we were aware of functionalities that were to be scrapped from final version. Presentation was easy with little preperation.

## What went well and lessons learned
The presentation went extremely well and I belive we learned alot about presenting as a group.

## Project management
The project is now officially finished, although Saku and Santeri are still working on tests for the project.


## Final thoughts
The project was an interesting product to work on for the last 7-8 weeks. From planning to the finalized version there were only a few things that were removed or leftout from the original idea.

## Next Steps
Saku and Santeri finalize the tests.
