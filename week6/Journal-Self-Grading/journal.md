# Week 6
## Peer assessment
Santeri Mulari 4. Did not make much progress with tasks in competition, but tried their best with time limits. Made signin and registering to app for project.

Saku Tuomennoro 4. Made little progress in competition, but did some assisting others. Made progress with finalizing shopping cart, with backend for project.

Atte Ristim√§ki 5. Was a huge help in the competition. Build backend modules for project

Kimi Taskinen 5. Wrote 60% of coding competition, receiving some help from others. Creating photo saving to MongoDB via GridFX.

## Challenges Faced
Creating the coding competition modules, we faced loads of struggle, which stagnated our progess causing us to fail the competition dead-line.

## What went well and lessons learned
Registering and authenticating with JWS Tokens and storing tokens onto logal- and session storage.

## Project management
Working on a smaller task has been a useful method for creating modules. But recently it has been difficult to divide sections to smaller tasks, which has caused weaker performanses. Much like in pairprogramming one person tends to be the most helpful at a time. With more people backseat coding it tends to get messy when directing, but on rare situations when both the coder and guide are lost others can be helpful.


## Final thoughts
The sixth weeks lectures were a lot less dense than last weeks. But that is not to say that they didn't contain lots of important information.

With local storage storing user levels to a website is much easier than previously percieved.

## Next Steps
Next week we are to present our sprint 2 or version 1 of the project as deadlines were extended. We have already almost finished sprint threes contents with certain sections perhaps upgraded on last spring.
