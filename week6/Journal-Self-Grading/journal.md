# Week 5
## Peer assessment

Saku Tuomennoro 5. Assisted in creating the presentation version for the project.

Atte Ristim√§ki 5. Was a huge help in the group activities and worked on the presentation version for the project.

## Challenges Faced
Working the CSS to a level that was originally planned has been rough and annoying. With minor tweaks breaking the entire styling for an element is frustrating and annoying especially when AI is rarely any help with CSS.

## What went well and lessons learned
Encrypting and hashing secretive information such as passwords into databases.

Including JSON Web Tokens for identification for certain activities or CRUD operations.

Rendering certain infortion onto React app with useEffect hooks in necessary situations such as getting data from database.

## Project management
Working on a smaller task that is harder to divide as a group has had it's difficulties. Much like in pairprogramming one person tends to be the most helpful at a time. With more people backseat coding it tends to get messy when directing, but on rare situations when both the coder and guide are lost others can be helpful.


## Final thoughts
The fifth weeks lectures were a lot less dense than last weeks. But that is not to say that they didn't contain lots of important information.

With encrypting and hashing getting taught, adding user levels to a website is soon a much familiar task and less daunting.

## Next Steps
Next week we are to present our sprint 2 or version 1 of the project. We have already made improvements onto it, but we are planning to present the version that we were able to manage by the deadline lastweek.
