# Week 7
## Peer assessment
Santeri Mulari 5. Was able to complete the authentication for the app using register and login funtionalities and JWT tokens. In addition completed the shopping carts user data section.

Saku Tuomennoro 5. Finalized the shopping cart funtionality and edited styling of the project.

Atte Ristim√§ki 5. Contributed hugely to adding product images to MongoDB, assisted with searchbar functionality and category page rendering.

Kimi Taskinen 5. Finalized home page with Hero carusel. Added product page accessability from categories. Assisted with searchbar setup and functionality. Researched GridFS for image upload, but we ended up using different method.

## Challenges Faced
Finalizing the app functionality had some snags but was overall smooth with minor issues. Adding images to MongoDB was the largest hurdle we witnessed with the addition of me getting sick before the presentations.

## What went well and lessons learned
Presenting the sprint 2 version and getting the project mostly finished has been smooth. We learned usingContext and useReduce functionalities during theory and those were implemented to project.

## Project management
Getting the majority of the app finished during the last days of the week has been a huge undertaking but also a somewhat smooth experience. With loads of tasks being divided and conquered. Everyone has done an equal size portion with tasks divided.


## Final thoughts
The week was hectic but managable, with only a few new theory sections the has been alot to do. Luckily there have been alot of time to relearn previous theories to finish tasks.

## Next Steps
Next week we are to finish and present the project as well as prepare for the exam.
