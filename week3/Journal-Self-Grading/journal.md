# Week 3
## Peer assessment
Santeri Mulari 5. Did great work with planning the framework for the project.

Saku Tuomennoro 5. Was a huge help in planning framework and start of project.

Atte Ristim√§ki 5. Assisted in planning the framework for the project.

Kimi Taskinen 5. Worked on the framework for the project.

## Challenges Faced
Planning the outlook, positions and operations of the project app. Planned the first steps in working with the code. The first pair programming sessions were quite weird but interesting experiences.

Working with home page for the project was a breeze for the most part with the exception of the CSS being a pain.

## What went well and lessons learned
Learned creating CRUD operation with working JSON responses. Adding of middleware to achieve different error handling as well as permission checking.

Learned how to get a working HTML website converted to a React App.

With the first pair programming session behind us I've learned a bit about being the guide as well as being the coder.

Others skilles that have improved are communication and time management skills. Team work has continued to work on a smooth level.

## Project management
Getting used to  Scrum meetings is still quite weird but we have tried to manage those to the best of our abilities. So far progress has been relatively easy.

We worked on the home page as a group with a single coder and others backseating, giving advice and instructions. This role will rotate with different short sessions.

## Final thoughts
Overall the third week has been an interesting experience with quite a lot of new information and new experiences. Alot of impactful information was handled during this week and the pair programming sessions are starting to feel more casual and less awkward.

## Next Steps
During the next weeks we are starting to work on the framework and the first modules for the project.
