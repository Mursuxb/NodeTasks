Our group had plenty of difficulties with Git as we are used to using Pycharms and IntelliJs integrated github version control systems.

## What went well and lessons learned
Learned the basics of using Git and Visual Studio Code. Writing node modules and exporting/importing to other programs. Using of nodes package manager has been an enlightful experience with few difficulties as it workes quite similarly to pip.
