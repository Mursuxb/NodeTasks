# Week 4
## Peer assessment
Santeri Mulari 5. Did great work with layout and backend portions of the project.

Saku Tuomennoro 5. Worked hard on the category page and the framework for the shopping cart.

Atte Ristim√§ki 5. Managed to create a gorgeous login module as well as a nearly finished register page. In addition he finished the home page for the first version.

Kimi Taskinen 5. Worked on the first model of the product page as well as merging the different portions together that we had worked on.

## Challenges Faced
Getting the necessary data onto product page from mock data and getting the CSS rules to work as intended were the most difficult sections during the week.

During the pair programming sections there were a few times where sharing the code was more difficult than usual but those were overcome quite quickly.

## What went well and lessons learned
Working on the React routing as well as layouting different elements.

On the serverside we learned the basics of MongoDB with creating new data and getting data with requests.

On the frontend we learned to use states to update the React app with changing data.

## Project management
We have attempted to work on the project in a Scrum format. Group working has been the most efficient way of getting the project to actively progress forward.

Pairprogramming as well as solo programming in a group call have both worked quite well, as we have gotten over most problems in a brisk manner with few hiccups.


## Final thoughts
The forth week was quite different as our lectures were on back to back days so the theory was quite heavy to unload. With pairprogramming and group project taking all the learned material into action has helped to cement the information better than on the first weeks where some things were forgotten more easily.

## Next Steps
Next on the project is to present the first version of the app/website as well as making the site more reactive with routes and middleware.
